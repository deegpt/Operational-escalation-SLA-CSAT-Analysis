## Research Questions

### 1. Which issue categories disproportionately drive escalations?

![escalation_rate by issue_category](docs/escalation_rate_by_issue_category.png)

> This concludes:
- Accounts-related issues have the highest escalation propensity, indicating frequent need for higher-level intervention.
- Compliance issues also escalate at a high rate, consistent with regulatory sensitivity.
- Cards and Payments, despite higher ticket volumes, escalate less frequently.
- Credit issues show the lowest escalation rate, suggesting that:
- Many credit issues may be resolved within standard workflows, or
- They are well-documented / policy-driven with fewer edge cases.

#### Visual explanation (descriptive)

> The bar chart shows variation in escalation rates across issue categories, with Accounts and Compliance appearing higher than Payments and Credit.

#### Statistical validation (inferential)

> However, a Chi-square test of independence (χ² = 5.11, p = 0.276) indicates that these differences are not statistically significant. Therefore, escalation likelihood cannot be conclusively attributed to issue category alone.

> **While escalation rates vary visually across issue categories, statistical testing does not support a significant association. This suggests that escalations are likely driven by underlying factors such as severity, resolution time, or SLA risk rather than issue category in isolation.**
